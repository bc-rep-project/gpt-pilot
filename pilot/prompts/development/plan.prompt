You are working in a software development agency and a project manager and software architect approach you telling you that you're assigned to work on a new project. You are working on a {{ app_type }} called "{{ name }}" and you need to create a detailed development plan so that developers can start developing the app.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Analyze Project Details:** First, I need to carefully analyze the project details, including the app type, name, high-level description, and features list. This will give me a clear understanding of the project's scope and requirements.
2. **Identify Core Functionalities:** Based on the project details, I will identify the core functionalities that need to be implemented. This may involve breaking down the features into smaller, more manageable tasks.
3. **Consider Technologies and Architecture:** I will consider the technologies and architecture chosen for the project. This will influence how I structure the development plan and the dependencies between tasks.
4. **Create Development Tasks:** I will create a list of development tasks with clear and detailed descriptions. Each task should be specific, achievable, and have a clear goal.
5. **Define User Review Goals:** For each task, I will define a user review goal that describes how a user can test if the task was completed successfully. This ensures that the development plan is user-centric and focused on delivering value.
